## Manage your code

1. Use MakeCode editor
- MakeCode editor can't save code on your browser
- If you want to save it, convert the code to Javascript and download it
- Then you add the Javascript code to this repository

2. Write Python or Javascript
- You could manage your code as usual by using github
- But if you want to deploy your code, you have to convert it to hex code
    - Basically, the conversion is done with MakeCode editor
